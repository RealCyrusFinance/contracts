# The Smart Contract Architecture:


Vault Contract – The core contract responsible for distributing deposited funds into third-party DeFi protocols - https://bscscan.com/address/0xe6995b6a450486d0d5851a91f7c980a6f2563960#code
Cyrus Position (NFT) – Every deposit is represented as a unique NFT that reflects your share in the vault. This makes positions tradable, transparent, and verifiable on-chain - https://bscscan.com/address/0x1BD1fED31abCE5f627985eCE2356c2972a353Ef7#code
Treasury Contract – Collects all generated rewards, manages yield distribution, and ensures depositors receive their share fairly and transparently - https://bscscan.com/address/0x934a09e280ef0cdee9f0d7a58b7c8302e53f7bdc#code
