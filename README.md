The Smart Contract Architecture:

Vault Contract – The core contract responsible for distributing deposited funds into third-party DeFi protocols - https://bscscan.com/address/0xdC7420960aB54127d2783F6ACE657e6aAd712E75#code

Cyrus Position (NFT) – Every deposit is represented as a unique NFT that reflects your share in the vault. This makes positions tradable, transparent, and verifiable on-chain - https://bscscan.com/address/0xa3aa5e5eb55aef8f3eb71d3f845fe212ecf39a2c#code

Treasury Contract – Collects all generated rewards, manages yield distribution, and ensures depositors receive their share fairly and transparently - https://bscscan.com/address/0xdde35c8d3eb9968ee8f701dac12e83f8bf5fbfcf#code
