The Smart Contract Architecture:

Vault Contract – The core contract responsible for distributing deposited funds into third-party DeFi protocols - https://bscscan.com/address/0xc03353F94613777B7C08360Be5D51Bb493a8B0F8#code

Cyrus Position (NFT) – Every deposit is represented as a unique NFT that reflects your share in the vault. This makes positions tradable, transparent, and verifiable on-chain - https://bscscan.com/address/0xd9a3Eb426b10656746e522aF36379A1291cCFDD3#code

Treasury Contract – Collects all generated rewards, manages yield distribution, and ensures depositors receive their share fairly and transparently - https://bscscan.com/address/0xb042Ea7B35826e6E537a63BB9fC9FB06B50aE10b#code
