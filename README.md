The Smart Contract Architecture:

Vault Contract – The core contract responsible for distributing deposited funds into third-party DeFi protocols - https://bscscan.com/address/0xEB9aee51eeABb350468C44F2f31580367441d72E#code

Cyrus Position (NFT) – Every deposit is represented as a unique NFT that reflects your share in the vault. This makes positions tradable, transparent, and verifiable on-chain - https://bscscan.com/address/0xe76125fe6557caa82bbb2443008e95c5893bc850#code

Treasury Contract – Collects all generated rewards, manages yield distribution, and ensures depositors receive their share fairly and transparently - https://bscscan.com/address/0x91661868D5201809cB5B0ECa203fd03E73d27d08#code
